# playersonline
/playersonline command

This mod came from "michielbos" some time ago. 
I don't remember how I got it, but I can't find it anymore on the Wurmonline forums.
Offering it here, mainly so I can find it again if I ever lose my copy.
Help yourself, but understand that I am not a coder and I can't help you out if it breaks, or breaks anything else.
It works for us, that's all I know.
